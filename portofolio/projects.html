        <h2 class="skill2">Galaxy Of Knowledge</h2>
        <h3 class="skill2">Galaxy Of Knowledge is an application I made by the help
            of iSchool, It contains many information about, Science, Physics, History,
            Art, And many more, It was made using FlutterFlow, Due to FlutterFlows easy
            to learn techniques, I was able to make it pretty good.

        <h2 class="skill2">Egypto</h2>
        <h3 class="skill2">This application was made to book trips for Egypt's tourists,
            It has a very basic and bland design due to not using very advanced detailing
            codes, But its fully functional and running.

        <h3 class="skill2">Im a really good designer once I get the hang of how the application works,
